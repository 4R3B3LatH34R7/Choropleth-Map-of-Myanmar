# Choropleth-Map-of-Myanmar
## A Choropleth Map of Myanmar in Excel using VBA
Since I resigned from my old job in 2015, I started working on this map project.</br>
But after some time working on it, like about 3/4 months, I got bored and move on to other projects.</br>
And then after like a year of exploring other fields like electronics, photography, etc., I always come back to this project.</br>
The issue then is that, every time, I return back to this project, I can't remember where I left off and,</br>
I can't remember what methods, functions and data structures were used anymore.</br>
And I am always forced to restart from scratch.</br>
That is the reason I wrote the VBA Project Info.</br></br>
This time around, I really thought that I am going to reach to a state where I can actually release this as a tool.</br>
But then, there were many obstacles which popped up like a Whac-A-Mole game, first, COVID-19, then Myanmar Coup starting from 01FEB2021.</br>
And nearing the finalization of this map project, I got sidetracked into VBA Project Info tool.</br>
I am so into VBA Project Info tool now that, I totally lost track of everything in this map project.</br>
Fortunately, after somewhere between 3 or 4 attempts to re-jump-start this project over 6 years, I finally have some understanding of
how I should do it better with each iteration.</br>
With each restarted version, I added more functions and understand how to write better code and more userfriendly functions,
which would enhance user experience many folds compared to the very first version of this map project.

### Choropleth Maps
Choropleth maps are different from heat (sisarithmic) maps in that the former uses pre-existing geographically defined areas to show data patterns while the latter just uses regions drawn according to the patterns of the variables...</br>
