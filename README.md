# Choropleth-Map-of-Myanmar
## A Choropleth Map of Myanmar in Excel using VBA
Since I resigned from my old job in 2015, I started working on this map project.</br>
But after some time working on it, like about 3/4 months, I got bored and move on to other projects.</br>
And then after like a year of exploring other fields like electronics, photography, etc., I always come back to this project.</br>
The issue then is that, every time, I return back to this project, I can't remember where I left off and,</br>
I can't remember what methods, functions and data structures were used anymore.</br>
And I am always forced to restart from scratch.</br>
That is the reason I wrote the VBA Project Info.</br>
